# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

# Brief Introduction
Behind every sale is a story of customer behavior, pricing decisions, and profitability. This sales performance report explores those stories by analyzing revenue, profit, discounts, customer retention, and product performance over time. The analysis highlights how sales volume does not always translate to profit, how discounts influence margins, and which customers and products truly drive sustainable growth. It showcases the power of data storytelling in turning transactional data into clear, actionable business insights.

# About The Dataset
This project is built on a five-table relational dataset comprising 9,994 order records, 793 customer records, 1,894 product records, 632 location records, and 49 state records. The dataset captures transactional sales data alongside detailed customer, product, and geographic attributes. It provides a strong foundation for analyzing sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, product trends, and regional dynamics.
